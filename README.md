There are two types of sheets in the system: "Actors" and "Items". Each sheet has two sub-types:

**ACTORS**

- **Princess Sheet** - The Princess Actor sheet is the character sheet used for player characters.
- **NPC** - NPC sheets should be used for all other creatures, including other characters like antagonists, commoners, and monsters.
